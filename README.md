## How to run the game
Ensure maven install and build is complete. Then, run Main. A Menu Screen will pop up. Press the play button, select the dificulty level of the game, and thereafter the number of players in the game. The map selection screen will show, and selecting a map will start the game. NOTE: it can take a second for the game screen to open.


## Known bugs
Currently throws "WARNING: An illegal reflective access operation has occurred", 
when the java version used is >8. This has no effect on function or performance, and is just a warning.
