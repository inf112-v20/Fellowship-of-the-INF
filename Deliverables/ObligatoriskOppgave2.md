# ObligatoriskOppgave2

## Deloppgave1:Project and project structure
For the first sprint had we chosen roles for just two of our members, as we did not think it was necesarry for more at that point. For this second sprint have we given out more roles, as we see it as necesary at this point.

### Roles
* Johanna: Group leader
* Martin: Contact Manager, Copyright Manager
* Erlend: Test Manager
* Henrik: Code Integrity and Tidiness
* Lena: Markdown Writer, Rules Lawyer

### Role Description
* Group leader: Keeps an overview of the project and the work of all the other members of the group.
* Contact Manager: Main source of communication between the group, the professor, and groupleaders.
* Copyright Manager: Keeps track of copyrighted material that we use, and that we do not infringe on anything.
* Test Manager: Makes sure that tests are made
* Code Integrity and Tidiness: Makes sure that the code that is written is readable and clean.
* Markdown Writer: Main writer of the Markdown documents, and makes sure that eveything is written for the assignments.
* Rules Lawyer: Main responsible for knowing the rules of the original RoboRally game.

### Retroperspective
In the first itteration were there little actual coding, which lead to an uneven spread of commits among the members. For this itteration have we done a lot more coding towards the mvp.
We have also had to sometimes move the extra meeting based on different reasons, such as waiting for more information, or other external reasons, f.ex. the moving of lectures.
There is some insecurities among members, where they do not know or understand what some of the others are doing. This might be solved by creating a comprehensive uml, or maybe more pair programming.

### Priorities
