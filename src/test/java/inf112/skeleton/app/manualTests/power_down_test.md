# Manual tests for power down  
## Setup  
* Run Main
* Press the Play button on the menu screen
* Press the 2 player button
* Select the second map


### Comment
* The player can take 9 damage, signified by the yellow triangles on the UI
* If all triangles fill up, you lose a life and respawn
* If you run out of lives during the test, you need to close the window, then do the setup again.
* In the setup phase of the game you can choose to go into power down instead of choosing any cards.
* This repairs all damage


## Power down test
* Use arrow keys to steer the player1 robot into a spot where it will be hit by a laser on the board
* Choose a couple of rotate cards to make the robot spin in place, and therefor take damage a couple of phases
* Press lock in button and enter after each phase to play through a round
* A couple of the triangles should now be lit up 
* On the next setup phase press the power down button, the red hexagon on the UI
* The next round should start, the damage should be repaired, and the robot should be doing nothing other than be affected by external sources, and shoooting lasers
