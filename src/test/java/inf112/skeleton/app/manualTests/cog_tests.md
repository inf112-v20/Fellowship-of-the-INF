### Tests
#### Test for rotating robot on a cog
* Complete setup.
* Click on the powerdown button in lower right corner of the screen. 
* (Computers players are already set to powerdown to make them stand still and make testing easier).
* Player 1 is standing on an anticlockwise turning cog and should rotate 90* to the left of its current direction
at the end of the phase(e.g. in phase 1 he is facing north at the beginning of the phase and should face west
at the end of the phase). 
* Player 2 is standing on a clockwise turning cog and should rotate 90* to the right of its current direction
 at the end of the phase(e.g. in phase 1 he is facing north at the beginning of the phase and should face east
 at the end of the phase).
 * You can press ENTER to go to the next phase and confirm that they are still rotating properly.
